                <h3>Why Should I invest, I am just a teenager?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>The most frequent question that strikes in our mind is "Why should I invest?, I am just a young
                        guy or a girl completely pampered by parents.". So basically I am assuming that you are an
                        average Indian middle class or upper middle class teenager. All over the life we are taught that
                        focus on your study, it's the only goal of your life till you get a successful job or something.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why Should I invest, I am just a teenager?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely A BIG No. Why I am supposed to go for a job while I can make my own fortune. The only
                        way to get this is How you consider opportunities, How you tackle problems, How you manage your
                        finances.

                        Let's assume a scenario there's a kid who used to play with his hairs from the very beginning of
                        his life, he kept doing this for years and years. One day he realized that he's not willingly
                        playing with hairs it was his HABIT now.

                        So we all need that habit in our lives. Investing and Saving must be our habit it must be a part
                        of our daily routine. Almost we all used to have piggy banks or maybe we currently have, it's
                        also a method to teach saving to the youngsters. So, being the first article let's keep it
                        Short.

                <h3>How small investments can become really huge?</h3>
                <p>Answering shortly, Yes it does. Even small investments become very huge. Our generation is really one
                    of the best generation as we have the internet as well as our parents' advice. We can easily combine
                    them and make best out of it.
                    Let's come to our topic now, How small Investments can become really huge over the time. As youth we
                    have a plenty of time to learn and make investments.
                    So, All we have to is start as early as possible. I might sound silly but that's true!

                    "Planning retirement at 18 is 33x times easier than planning it at 40's"

                    I think most of the readers know about the 8th wonder of the world "The Compound interest". I am not
                    saying this Sir Albert Einstein said this.

                    So, simply use it to make a fortune.

                    If a boy named John want to invest for his retirement at the age of 18 and he's having 5k INR and he
                    knew a bit so he went to bank and simply asked that he want an fixed deposit of 5k INR for 42 years
                    of his life. Somehow they agreed in any scheme and invested his sum at interest rate of 7% PA
                    compounded quarterly.

                    Our smart John got an FD reciept with the mature amount written 92.2k INR.

                    So, simply John was dumb person. Getting an retirement fund is not that easy too.

                    Assume if he tried a little more and found a way to get returns of 15% a year. He will ne getting
                    2.4M INR instead of that 92k INR.

                    Many of you may think that 15% returns looks fishy, but stay tuned it's easy.</p>
